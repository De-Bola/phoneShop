# phoneShop
Project is in C language, an implementation of linked lists in C
This is a file management system for a phone store.
User can view available phones, search for phones by maker and model.
User can also perform the traditional CRUD operation with this.
next step is to make a remote db for the app.

CLion was the compiler I have used. Code has been debugged with 
valgrind at an earlier stage. valgrind check will be performed again.
Although previous valgrind errors have been rectified.

phoneShop also keeps a timestamped logging of user activities.
